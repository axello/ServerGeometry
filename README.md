# Server Graphics
CGRect, CGPoint and CGSize are missing from Server Side Swift implementations, because UIKit is not available on linux. The classes in this repo provide an alternative to use if you need basic geometry in your project.
I have tried to use similar methods to the original structs.

### _Caveat:_
Currently implementing the unit tests. TDD be damned!

## Rectangle

## Point

## Size
